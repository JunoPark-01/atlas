        <h1>Genshin Instrumentals</h1>
        <p>
            Although within most of the gaming communities the ambience/background music may not always be
            the first thing people gravitate to a game for. However, within a particular game called 
            <strong>Genshin Impact</strong>, their attention to what instruments are played within different
            locations, the music of places where they are inspired by real life examples, and yet their ability 
            to adapt such cultural music to the modern world to experience. All this, if not most of the credit 
            can be attributed to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Peng_Chen">Yu-Peng Chen</a></strong> 
            alongside <strong>Mihoyo</strong>'s(Creators of <strong>Genshin Impact</strong>) own music creation team
